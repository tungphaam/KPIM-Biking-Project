# KPIM-Biking-Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing sales data for KPIM Biking Corporation, a bike manufacturing company. The company operates through two main channels: an Online Store for Individual Customers and distribution through Sales Contacts and Distributors.

## Situation

As a member of the KPIM Analytics Team, my role is creating a dashboard that provides valuable insights into the sales performance of the company. I have been provided with data from the SQL database in Excel format (refer to the Data Tab). The Sales Manager has tasked me with creating a dynamic dashboard that can be easily updated with new data in the future. The dashboard should include charts, graphs, and detailed tables to identify key sales metrics for the sales team.

## Data

The dataset encompasses all orders booked in 2014, categorized into two main customer types: IN for individual customers and SC for sales contacts. Relevant information for analysis includes product hierarchy, territory, sales programs, various time periods (order, ship, due date), and the Line Total, representing the actual revenue received for each order.

## Requirements

The primary objective is to analyze the data and create a comprehensive report in Excel, incorporating charts, graphs, and tables. The report should address the following key aspects for the Sales Team:

1. **Monthly Revenue Comparison:**
   - Compare revenue for the current month to the previous month.
   - Calculate the growth rate.

2. **Monthly Sales Performance:**
   - Display revenue for each month of the current year.
   - Highlight month-over-month growth rates.

3. **Customer Type Analysis:**
   - Determine the ratio between individual customers (IN) and sales contacts (SC).
   - Evaluate the growth rate for each customer type.

4. **Product Performance:**
   - Analyze revenue for each product category, sub-category, and individual product for the current month compared to the previous month.
   - Examine the growth rate for each category, sub-category, and product.
   - Consider territory and sales promotion effects.

5. **Promotion Impact:**
   - Investigate whether promotions have a positive impact on sales growth.

6. **Additional Analysis:**
   - Explore any other significant findings or insights derived from the data.
